# Game Master Toolbox — Local Server

To run the site locally without typing the PowerShell server command every time, use the included npm script and VS Code task:

1. Install dependencies once:

   npm install

2. Start the server (either):

   - From command line: npm start
   - From VS Code: Run Task → "Serve Site (npm start)"

The site will be served on http://localhost:8000. Use the Live Server extension instead if you prefer a different workflow.
