They are fierce predators that hunt in small family groups, swooping down from high rocky eyries to claim their prey. They are particularly fond of horseflesh and will often ignore other potential meals to hunt a horse or hippogriff. While difficult to tame, a griffon raised from an egg can become a loyal and formidable mount.",

      "Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze."

      "Action. Telekinetic Thrust. The poltergeist targets a creature or unattended object within 30 feet of it. A creature must be Medium or smaller to be affected by this magic, and an object can weigh up to 150 pounds. If the target is a creature, the poltergeist makes a Charisma check contested by the target's Strength check. If the poltergeist wins the contest, the poltergeist pushes the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved. If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the poltergeist pushes it up to 30 feet in any direction. The poltergeist can use the object as a ranged weapon, making a ranged attack roll with a +4 bonus to hit and dealing an appropriate amount of damage (usually 1d6 bludgeoning damage, or 2d6 bludgeoning damage for an especially heavy object)."

They are rarely seen, known only by the crashing of furniture and the invisible strikes they deal to those who enter their territory.",

If he so chooses, he can speak through a bodak to address his enemies and followers directly. A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out its former allies and enemies alike to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life. Minions of Orcus are the one exception to this compulsion; a bodak recognizes them as kindred souls and spares them from its wrath.

Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with power for the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. In either case, a dragonshield is skilled at hand-to-hand combat and bears a shield made of dragon scales, as well as scars from desperate fights. Dragonshields know they have a place of honor among those who venerate dragons, but—being kobolds at heart—most of them feel unworthy of their status and are desperate to prove themselves deserving of it. But they also have the ability to rally in the face of certain death, inspiring others to follow them into battle.",

These sorcerers typically fill the role of advisor, and when threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with colorful magic. A scale sorcerer who resides in or near a dragon's lair may serve as that dragon's diplomat and mouthpiece—anticipating the dragon's needs, issuing commands to others on the dragon's behalf, and reporting information back to the dragon. Such scale sorcerers often wear artificial wings, which are a sign of their draconic office. Scale sorcerers are just as awed by and respectful of dragons as others who venerate these mighty creatures, but they know that duty requires them not to fawn over their master at all times. They also understand that their frequent proximity to their dragon master means they would probably be the first to die if their master became angry or displeased, so they frantically maintain a balance between adoration and terror in their behavior toward their master.",
