They are fierce predators that hunt in small family groups, swooping down from high rocky eyries to claim their prey. They are particularly fond of horseflesh and will often ignore other potential meals to hunt a horse or hippogriff. While difficult to tame, a griffon raised from an egg can become a loyal and formidable mount.",

      "Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze."

While generally docile unless provoked, they are highly motivated by hunger and will pursue anyone carrying large amounts of metal, often ignoring the person to feast on their armor and weapons.",

      "Action. Telekinetic Thrust. The poltergeist targets a creature or unattended object within 30 feet of it. A creature must be Medium or smaller to be affected by this magic, and an object can weigh up to 150 pounds. If the target is a creature, the poltergeist makes a Charisma check contested by the target's Strength check. If the poltergeist wins the contest, the poltergeist pushes the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved. If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, the poltergeist pushes it up to 30 feet in any direction. The poltergeist can use the object as a ranged weapon, making a ranged attack roll with a +4 bonus to hit and dealing an appropriate amount of damage (usually 1d6 bludgeoning damage, or 2d6 bludgeoning damage for an especially heavy object)."

They are rarely seen, known only by the crashing of furniture and the invisible strikes they deal to those who enter their territory.",

The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n4. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.
